### Prompt
TBD

### Presentation
A seven-minute presentation (you will be cut off!) showcasing your answers to parts 1. and 2. above to a non-technical audience. At the end, you may be asked questions.

You will be evaluated by a panel of judges on a score of 1 to 5 on each of the four following criteria:
1.	Data-Driven Solutions (Did the team present solutions backed by evidence and data? Are assumptions and decisions rooted in research?)
2.	Implementation & Feasibility (Did the team create a workable program? Did the team appropriately address logistics such as cost, timeline, and implementation?)
3.	Methods (Did the team apply appropriate methods? Did the team communicate findings appropriately?)
4.	Visualization (Are findings presented in a visually appealing manner? Are the data visualizations clean? Do they clearly communicate the intended point?)

The judging will occur based on your presentation. We will not have an opportunity to review code, etc. before declaring a winner.

### Hackathon Best Practices
1. Get everyone on the same page. Decide how decisions will be made. Use different people for their strengths.
2. Set up deadlines. Add a buffer. Stick to the deadlines as best as you can. For example, make the project "due" at 3:00. Then, when does modeling need to conclude? When does EDA need to conclude? Is the timeline "linear" or can things happen simultaneously?
3. Develop a strategy quickly. It is to your benefit to have a strategy decided in the first hour than to "EDA" toward a strategy for a couple of hours.
4. If the existing data is insufficient, gather more. However, don't spend all day gathering data or conducting EDA.
5. Answer the prompt! A simple complete answer beats a complex incomplete answer.
